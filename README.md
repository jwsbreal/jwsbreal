## Hi there, I'm Jonathan 👋
I've been studying technologies since 2024, starting with C#, also HTML, CSS and now, learning Javascript, Typescript, React and Figma. I'm building a solid foundation in Front-end technologies to become a great professional. 

Here are a little more about me:

- 🏃🏿‍♂️ I'm in a career transition!
- 💻 Also participating in the DIO bootcamp - data analysis.
- 🔎 Searching for my first job opportunity.
